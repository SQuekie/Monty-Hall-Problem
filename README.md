# Monty-Hall-Problem

Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. <br />
You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. <br />
He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? <br />

The program will run the simulation according to your preferred number of times to prove that switching will always be better.<br />
Expected to win ~66.6% of the time if you switch to the other choice<br />
Expected to win ~33.3% of the time if you stick to your frist choice<br />
